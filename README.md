# sARDenMTS

A SAS-native authoring framework for CDISC Analysis Results Metadata Technical Specification (ARM-TS).   
Users define ARS-compliant study, analysis, and output metadata via simple SAS macros that append to normalized metadata tables.   
The package validates key constraints and exports a hierarchical YAML ARM-TS file using yaml_writer.  
Designed to integrate seamlessly with sARDen (ARD builder), with the longer-term goal of fully metadata-driven, reproducible TLF production. This integration layer is currently under active development.
